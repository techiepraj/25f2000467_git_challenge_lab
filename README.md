# Git Challenge Lab: Personal Profile Website

**Student Roll No:** 25f2000467

## Project Description

This is a simple multi-page personal profile website created with HTML. The primary goal of this project was to practice and demonstrate a professional Git and GitHub workflow, including the use of feature branches and pull requests for adding new content.

## Pages Included

This website consists of the following pages:

* **Home (`index.html`):** The main landing page.
* **About Me (`about.html`):** A page with personal information.
* **Contact (`contact.html`):** A page with contact details.

## How to View the Website

Since this is a static website built with HTML, you can view it by following these steps:

1.  Clone this repository to your computer.
2.  Open the project folder.
3.  Double-click the `index.html` file to open it directly in your web browser.

## Git Workflow

Each new page (`about.html` and `contact.html`) was developed on its own dedicated feature branch and then merged into the `main` branch via a Pull Request on GitHub.
